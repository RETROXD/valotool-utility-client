# Translate Feature
The translate command allows you to send messages in different languages directly in the game chat
For example, entering this command: `!t <lang code> <message text>` will automatically translate outgoing messages.

Messages in the chat, if translate from another language will be displayed to you in both your own language and the original, as well as the codes to identify the languages.

You will see both languages and the code, but everyone else will only see the translated message.

You can configure your language and chat settings easily

In order to have incoming messages auto-translated you will have to create a DeepL Account and get an API key, this is a bit of a pain but the only translate engine I have implemented at the moment that's stable enough for incoming chat (google gets rate limited).

A list of all language codes can be found on the client for both DeepL and Google

Emojis are sent as normal messages in chat, simply send `:emoji_name:` and it will send the value of that emoji
